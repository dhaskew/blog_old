I’ve tried using [Day One] to journal, but long-form journalling is a time suck.  Plus, I have this blog.  Writing in multiple places is ok, but it has a downside.  When I sit down to write I have to make a decision ..

> “Where, if anywhere, should this go?"

I hate that decision, so I’m not going to make it anymore.   I’m just going to blog.  Not only that, I’m not going to worry about how long it is, because a [single sentence] may be enough.

Stay tuned.
