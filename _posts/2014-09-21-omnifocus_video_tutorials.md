I have been learning to use [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) and I stubled upon a set of videos that do a good job of showing how to use it.  The first one is embeded below.

If you are serious about learning Omnifocus, then do yourself a favor and checkout the whole [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAPB-hBvcrY&index=1&list=PL_QDAYColR6MjM9zV8z_7UlZRZWt0jW3W). 

I hope this helps.
