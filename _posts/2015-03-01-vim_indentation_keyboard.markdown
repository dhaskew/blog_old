I love [Vim].  I don't care if I sound like a broken record.  [Vim] is very keyboard friendly if you learn to [use it correctly].  Learning [Vim] can take a while, but its so worth it.  

Today’s tip is about indentation.

If you need to indent text, here’s an example of how to indent the next 5 lines of text, including the one the cursor is on.

{% keyboard_shortcut 5 > > %}

Hopefully that helps.
