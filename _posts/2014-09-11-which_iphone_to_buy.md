I'm planning to buy a new iPhone, but I'm not sure which one to buy.  The indecision is mostlyly due to the larger size(s) of the new models. I stumbled upon the following tweat that helped put it in perspective.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><p>Here&#39;s how the new iPhone sizes compare with iPads. The iPhone 6 Plus doesn&#39;t seem that big next to the iPad mini. <a href="http://t.co/HrIo3nfJAB">pic.twitter.com/HrIo3nfJAB</a></p>&mdash; Chris Johanesen (@chrisjohanesen) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisjohanesen/status/509530012974710785">September 10, 2014</a></blockquote>

My wife was not convinced from the pictures that the 6+ would fit in her purse/pockets/etc ... so I cut some mockups out of cardboard. As you can tell, my 4S has seen better days!

We are both going with the 6+.  Its big, but we've decided it should be manageable.
