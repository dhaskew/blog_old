Are you interested in learning more about the technology stack that powers this website?  If so, you can see behind the curtain by reviewing the [Github repo](https://github.com/dhaskew/blog).

Quick summary for the lazy ...

* I host the website on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
* I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to create a (mostly) static website.
* I write my posts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* I utilize several [plugins](https://github.com/dhaskew/blog/tree/master/_plugins), one of which I [wrote myself]({% post_url 2014-08-15-jekyll_plugin_1 %}).

Feel free to [contact me]({{site.url}}/contact.html) if you have any questions.  I'll do my best to respond in a timely fashion.

I hope this helps.
