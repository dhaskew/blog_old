title: Give Back This Holiday Season
category: posts
---

If you're like me, you probably have a lot to be thankful for this holiday season. I've been lucky enough to get a [new job], survive more than one [car accident], and get married.  I'm a lucky guy and I know it. This post isn't really about me though. (Ok, maybe a little.) 

This post is about us. Some of us aren't quite as lucky. Some of us need some help some times.  Do something "lucky" for someone else. 

Ok, back to me. One of the ways I personally give back is by helping the [Peace Corps] write web applications like [PC Medlink].  Its something I've started doing over the past 6 months and something I hope to continue doing.

What are you doing?  What could you be doing?

Do something.

Start now.
