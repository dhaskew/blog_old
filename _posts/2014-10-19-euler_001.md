Having just finished the [Rails Engineering] course at the [IronYard], I am looking for additional ways to strengthen my Ruby knowledge. Subsequently, I am working through some of the [Project Euler] problems. Below is the solution for [Problem 001].

{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
items = []
(1...1000).each { |num| items << num if num % 3 == 0 || num % 5 == 0 }
answer = items.reduce(:+)
{% endhighlight %}
