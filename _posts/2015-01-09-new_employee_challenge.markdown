I heard someone say the other day something to the effect of  …

> “I’m new at work and I’m not yet sure yet how my performance will be judged."

New jobs can be hard.  I like to have some idea about how I will be judged even before I start.  I almost always ask the hiring manager.  Sometimes, though, that’s easier said than done. 

Regardless of how your performance metrics are calculated, just remember:

> "As an employee: Your challenge is to become an obviously good investment."

Note: I’m not sure where that quote came from.  If you know, please [contact me].
