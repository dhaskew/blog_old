I took some technical training from [Cigital] recently.  I was pleased with both the instructors and the quality of the learning materials.  If you or your organization need help writing or learning to write secure code, then they can probably help.  I'm not sure what it costs, because I didnt pay for it.  I do know I learned a lot and otherwise liked it.

Worth a look.
