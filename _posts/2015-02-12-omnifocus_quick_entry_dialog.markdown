title: Omnifocus Quick Entry Dialog

As I’ve said before, I’m actively learning about [how to use Omnifocus] to my advantage.  As a result,  I use the [Omnifocus] quick entry dialog all the time now.  Anytime I have an action item to capture I hit the global hotkey, which in my case is:

{% keyboard_shortcut control option space %}

Up until now, I’ve used that shortcut to add an item and if I had another item to add I would hit save and execute the keyboard shortcut again.  That’s all fine and good, but I was convinced there must be a way to add multiple items in the same quick entry dialog.

It turns out that the keyboard shortcut to add an additional item in the quick entry dialog if it already is displayed is:

{% keyboard_shortcut control return %}

You are now free to take over the planet.  I hope that helps!
