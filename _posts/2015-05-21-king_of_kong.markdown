I watched [King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters] recently and it brought back so many memories.  If you grew up in love with classic arcade games then you need to watch it immediately. Go now, what are you waiting for?

Currently, you can [watch it free here] on IMDB.  Also, you can find [more info on Wikipedia].

Fun stuff!
