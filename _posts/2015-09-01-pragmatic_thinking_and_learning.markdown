Don’t you just love when you’re in the shower and a good idea springs into your head, or you solve a tough problem you didn’t even realize you where thinking about?  Its amazing and the more I learn about “R-mode” thinking the more I want to learn to encourage it.  That’s why I’m rereading [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning] by [The Pragmatic Programmers].  It’s a very interesting read.  Its awesome, and I recomend it.

This book very well may make you think differently about the way learn new things.

The upside down drawing exercise was especially enlightening, in large part because I can’t draw.  I thought I couldn’t draw.   But, as it turns out, if I think less I am able to do more.

This book is hard to describe, but has been well worth my time.  To say its a "Right Brain vs Left Brain" discussion would sell it way short.  Its so much more than that.

I hope that helps you.
