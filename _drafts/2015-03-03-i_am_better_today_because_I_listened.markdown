What did I do today that made my life better?

Based on a recommendation by a senior engineer, I read a chapter in a book called [Writing Solid Code].

Reading a chapter from a book didnâ€™t make my life better, but soaking in the experience of a senior developer did.  It was just a ten page read about debugging, but it proved to be directly applicable to a project I was working on.

[Writing Solid Code]: http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Solid-Code-20th-Anniversary/dp/1570740550/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1424376822&sr=8-1&keywords=writing+solid+code
