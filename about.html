<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
My name is David Askew, and I like to build things.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I'm hired to build things.  I've worked with some world class organizations.  Organizations such as <a href="http://www.cerner.com">Cerner</a>, <a href="http://www.ahss.org">Adventist Health</a>, <a href="http://www.mch.com">Miami Children's Hospital</a>, <a href="http://www.catholichealthinit.org/">Catholic Health Initiatives</a> and many others.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I build things that need building. I have helped the <a href="https://www.peacecorps.gov">PeaceCorps</a> build <a href="https://pcmedlink.org">PC Medlink</a>, an app that helps field operatives get supplies to some of the most remote places on earth.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I build things because I want them to exist.
</p>
<p>
I have authored <a href="http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Vpnc">open source documentation</a>. I make it a point to try and share everything I know.
</p>

<p>
What will I do in the future?  Who knows!  Contact me if you've got any good ideas!
